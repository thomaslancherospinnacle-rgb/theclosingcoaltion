    "question": "Michael owns a small business in Tennessee.  After thieves broke in and stole equipment because he left the back door unlocked, his insurer denied the claim.  Which legal concept allows an insurer to deny coverage when the policyholder’s negligence contributes to the loss?",
    "correct": "Contributory negligence (modified comparative fault)",
    "explanation": "Tennessee follows a modified comparative negligence system.  If an insured’s actions directly increase the risk of loss — for example by leaving a door unlocked — the insurer can reduce or deny payment because the policyholder contributed to the loss.  Proximate cause is about identifying the primary cause of a loss, estoppel prevents an insurer from taking a position contrary to previous representations, and contracts of adhesion refer to the non‑negotiable nature of insurance policies.",

    "question": "Which of the following is an unfair trade practice under Tennessee insurance laws that could subject a producer to disciplinary action?",
    "correct": "Promising a prospective client that a specific claim will be paid before underwriting is complete",
    "explanation": "Under Tennessee’s Unfair Trade Practices Act, misrepresentations or false statements about policy coverage are prohibited.  Telling a consumer that a claim will be paid without underwriting is a misrepresentation because the producer does not yet know whether the risk will be accepted.  Offering small promotional gifts within statutory limits, explaining coverage in plain language and declining to write high‑risk business based on sound underwriting are all permitted.",
    "difficulty": "easy",
    "wrongs": [
      "Offering a promotional gift valued at $20 for a referral",
      "Explaining policy benefits in simple terms",

  {
    "question": "Under Tennessee law, how long must an insurance producer maintain client and transaction records after a policy terminates or a transaction is completed?",
    "correct": "At least five years",
    "explanation": "Tennessee regulations require insurers, general agents and producers to keep records used in insurance transactions for at least five years after the policy terminates or the transaction is completed.  These records must be available to the commissioner for market conduct examinations.  Keeping records for three, six or seven years is not sufficient under the Tennessee rules.",

  {
    "question": "Sarah owns a universal life insurance policy.  After two years she withdraws some of the accumulated cash value and notices that her policy’s death benefit has decreased.  Why would a partial withdrawal cause the death benefit to go down?",
    "correct": "Withdrawals from the cash value reduce the policy’s death benefit unless the policyholder adjusts the benefit",
    "explanation": "Universal life policies have flexible premiums and cash‑value accounts.  Any loan or withdrawal taken from the cash value will reduce both the cash value and the death benefit until the withdrawal is repaid or the benefit is adjusted.  Universal life policies do not automatically convert to term insurance, surrender charges apply only upon surrendering the entire policy, and no grace‑period issue is mentioned in this scenario.",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "wrongs": [
      "The policy automatically converted to a term policy",
      "The insurer applied a surrender charge, reducing the death benefit",
      "The policy entered the grace period because premiums were missed"

  {
    "question": "Which of the following is not a legal requirement for cancellation of a Tennessee homeowners or personal property policy?",
    "correct": "Allowing the policyholder to provide additional information to prevent cancellation",
    "explanation": "State law requires insurers to provide at least 10 days’ notice before cancelling a personal risk policy for non‑payment of premium and at least 20 days’ notice for cancellation due to underwriting reasons.  The cancellation notice must include the effective date and state the reason for cancellation upon request.  There is no statutory requirement that insurers give the policyholder an opportunity to provide additional information or plead their case before cancellation.",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "wrongs": [
      "Providing at least 10 days’ notice when cancelling for non‑payment of premiums",

  {
    "question": "Under Tennessee insurance law, which of the following practices constitutes rebating and is prohibited for producers?",
    "correct": "Refunding part of the producer’s commission to the client as an incentive to buy a policy",
    "explanation": "Rebating occurs when a producer offers or returns any portion of the premium, commission or other valuable consideration to induce the purchase of an insurance policy.  Tennessee law specifically prohibits offering to refund part of the producer’s commission as an inducement.  Adjusting premiums based on the insured’s risk profile is legal underwriting, and giving small promotional items is permitted if their value is within statutory limits.",

  {
    "question": "Which type of coverage is not included in a standard Tennessee business owner’s policy (BOP)?",
    "correct": "Workers’ compensation coverage",
    "explanation": "A business owner’s policy is a package policy that combines commercial property coverage, general liability coverage and business interruption coverage.  It does not include workers’ compensation, professional liability or health insurance.  Employers must purchase workers’ compensation coverage separately to comply with Tennessee law.",
    "difficulty": "easy",

  {
    "question": "Which statement about the fiduciary responsibilities of Tennessee insurance producers is true?",
    "correct": "Producers must hold clients’ premium funds in a fiduciary (trust) capacity and may not use them for personal expenses",
    "explanation": "Tennessee law requires producers to treat premium funds as trust funds.  Money received for soliciting, negotiating or selling insurance must be held in a fiduciary capacity and cannot be commingled or misappropriated.  This duty applies to all lines of insurance, not just life insurance, and producers must provide an accounting of funds upon request.",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "wrongs": [
      "Producers may commingle client funds with business funds if records are kept",
      "Fiduciary responsibility applies only to life insurance policies",
      "Producers need not account for client funds unless specifically asked"

  {
    "question": "Which scenario describes the unfair trade practice known as twisting?",
    "correct": "A producer persuades a client to replace an existing policy with a new one by providing misleading information about the current policy",
    "explanation": "Twisting is the practice of inducing a policyholder to replace an existing policy with a new one through misrepresentation.  The agent typically emphasizes perceived deficiencies in the current contract or misstates benefits of the new contract in order to earn a new commission.  Recommending additional coverage or a replacement that truly improves coverage is not twisting.",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "wrongs": [
      "A producer encourages a client to purchase additional coverage for their home",
      "A producer replaces a policy with one that provides significantly better coverage",
      "A producer suggests moving to another insurer for a better premium rate without misrepresentation"

    "question": "Under Tennessee workers’ compensation laws, which statement is correct?",
    "correct": "Most businesses must carry workers’ compensation coverage if they employ five or more people, but construction employers must carry coverage regardless of the number of employees",
    "explanation": "Tennessee law requires employers in most industries to provide workers’ compensation coverage when they have five or more employees.  In the construction industry, coverage is mandatory even if there is only one employee.  Sole proprietors can elect to cover themselves but are not required to do so.  Workers’ compensation benefits include both medical expenses and lost wages.",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "wrongs": [
      "All Tennessee employers must provide workers’ compensation regardless of the number of employees",
      "Sole proprietors are required to cover themselves",

    "question": "John owns a restaurant in Tennessee and carries a business owner’s policy with business interruption coverage.  A fire forces the restaurant to close for two months.  What will the business interruption coverage pay for?",
    "correct": "John’s lost income during the two‑month closure and continuing operating expenses",
    "explanation": "Business interruption coverage reimburses the insured for lost revenue and ongoing expenses (such as payroll or rent) during the period of restoration when operations are suspended due to a covered peril like fire.  Physical damage to equipment would fall under property coverage, the cost of purchasing a new policy is not covered, and legal fees from liability claims would be handled under liability coverage.",
    "difficulty": "easy",
    "wrongs": [
      "The cost to repair the damaged kitchen equipment",
      "The cost of purchasing a new insurance policy after the fire",

    ]
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is considered misrepresentation and thus an unfair trade practice under Tennessee law?",
    "correct": "Falsely stating that a policy includes coverage that it does not provide",
    "explanation": "Misrepresentation involves providing false or misleading information about a policy’s benefits, conditions or terms.  Claiming a policy covers something when it does not is a clear example.  Offering small promotional gifts, speaking truthfully about a competitor’s policy and recommending additional coverage based on a client’s needs are allowed practices.",
    "difficulty": "easy",
    "wrongs": [
      "Offering a client a promotional gift valued at $15",
      "Providing truthful information about a competitor’s policy",
      "Recommending additional coverage based on a client’s risk profile"

  },
  {
    "question": "How many days’ notice must a Tennessee insurer provide before non‑renewing a personal auto insurance policy?",
    "correct": "At least 30 days’ notice",
    "explanation": "Under Tennessee law, insurers must mail or deliver a notice of their intention not to renew a personal risk policy, including auto insurance, at least 30 days prior to the policy’s expiration.  Ten‑day and twenty‑day notice periods apply to cancellations, not to non‑renewals.",
    "difficulty": "easy",

  {
    "question": "Emily, a Tennessee homeowner, disagrees with her insurer’s damage estimate after a storm.  What is the best course of action under Tennessee law?",
    "correct": "Hire a public adjuster to provide an independent estimate",
    "explanation": "If a homeowner disagrees with an insurer’s estimate, the insured may engage a licensed public adjuster to prepare an independent assessment of the damage.  Once armed with another estimate, the homeowner can negotiate with the insurer or, if necessary, file a complaint with the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance.  Cancelling the policy or withholding premiums will not resolve the dispute.",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "wrongs": [
      "Accept the insurer’s estimate and immediately file a complaint",
      "Cancel the policy and find a new insurer",

  {
    "question": "Which statement accurately describes Tennessee’s workers’ compensation requirements for construction employers?",
    "correct": "Workers’ compensation is required for all construction employers, regardless of the number of employees",
    "explanation": "In Tennessee the construction industry is subject to stricter rules than other industries.  Any construction employer must carry workers’ compensation insurance, even if there is only one worker.  Non‑construction employers must obtain coverage only when they have five or more employees.  Sole proprietors and partners may exempt themselves from coverage if they meet statutory conditions.",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "wrongs": [
      "Workers’ compensation is optional for construction employers",
      "Construction employers must provide coverage only if they have ten or more employees",
      "Sole proprietors in construction are always exempt from workers’ compensation requirements"
    ]
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is not a valid reason for a Tennessee insurer to cancel a personal auto insurance policy?",
    "correct": "The insured was involved in a single minor accident",
    "explanation": "Tennessee law does not allow insurers to cancel an auto policy solely because the insured was involved in one minor accident.  Non‑payment of premium, material misrepresentation or fraud in the application and the revocation or suspension of a driver’s license are valid reasons for cancellation.  Insurers may also cancel within the first 60 days of a new policy for underwriting reasons.",
    "difficulty": "easy",
    "wrongs": [
      "The insured failed to pay premiums",
      "The insured committed fraud when applying for the policy",
      "The insured’s driver’s license was revoked"
    ]
  },
  {
    "question": "After an insurance producer mistakenly records a client’s age incorrectly on a life application, resulting in a lower premium, what will the insurer typically do when the error is discovered?",
    "correct": "Adjust the death benefit to reflect the premium actually paid",
    "explanation": "Life policies contain a misstatement‑of‑age clause.  If the insured’s age was misstated, the insurer will adjust the death benefit to the amount that the paid premium would have purchased at the correct age.  Policies are not cancelled solely for an honest age mistake, and producers are not personally required to pay the difference or bill the client retroactively.",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "wrongs": [
      "Cancel the policy and refund the premiums",
      "Require the producer to pay the premium difference",
      "Retroactively bill the client for the difference in premiums"
    ]
  },
  {
    "question": "Which policies are required to offer uninsured motorist coverage in Tennessee?",
    "correct": "Both personal and commercial auto policies",
    "explanation": "Tennessee law mandates that all auto insurance policies — personal and commercial — include uninsured motorist coverage at limits that match the bodily injury liability limits unless the policyholder rejects the coverage in writing.  Policyholders may choose to reject or lower the coverage, but the offer must be made.",
    "difficulty": "easy",

  {
    "question": "In Tennessee, how long does an insured normally have to submit a written proof of loss after a covered event?",
    "correct": "Within 90 days after the loss",
    "explanation": "Standard insurance policies issued in Tennessee require the insured to furnish written proof of loss within 90 days after the date of the loss (or within 90 days after the end of a period for which the insurer is liable in the case of periodic benefits).  The time limit may be extended if it was not reasonably possible to give proof sooner, but the proof must still be submitted as soon as reasonably possible.  Ten‑, thirty‑ and sixty‑day periods are incorrect.",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "wrongs": [
      "Ten days after the loss",
      "Thirty days after the loss",
      "Sixty days after the loss"

  {
    "question": "What is the minimum bodily injury liability limit per person required for auto insurance in Tennessee?",
    "correct": "$25,000 per person",
    "explanation": "Tennessee’s financial responsibility law requires drivers to carry liability insurance with minimum limits of $25,000 for bodily injury to one person in one accident, $50,000 for bodily injury to two or more people per accident, and $25,000 for property damage.  These limits are commonly expressed as 25/50/25.  The other amounts listed do not meet Tennessee’s statutory requirement.",

    "question": "Sarah bought a health insurance policy in Tennessee.  Two months later she is diagnosed with a condition she had before purchasing the policy.  Her insurer refuses to pay for treatment, citing a pre‑existing condition clause.  Is this denial valid?",
    "correct": "No, insurers cannot deny claims for pre‑existing conditions once a policy is in effect",
    "explanation": "Under the Affordable Care Act and Tennessee regulations, health insurers cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of a pre‑existing condition.  Once a major medical policy is issued and active, the insurer must cover the insured’s medical needs, even if the condition existed before the effective date.  Coverage may be denied only if the insured failed to disclose the condition fraudulently or the plan is a grandfathered policy not subject to the ACA.",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "wrongs": [
      "Yes, the denial is valid because the condition existed before the policy was issued",
      "Yes, if Sarah failed to disclose the condition on her application",
      "No, because Tennessee requires a six‑month waiting period before denying such claims"

  {
    "question": "How often must Tennessee insurance producers renew their licenses?",
    "correct": "Every two years",
    "explanation": "Tennessee insurance producers must renew their licenses every two years.

  {
    "question": "Which of the following would not be considered rebating or an illegal inducement under Tennessee insurance law?",
    "correct": "Providing a client with educational brochures about insurance products",
    "explanation": "Rebating involves offering any value not stated in the policy to induce someone to purchase insurance.  Educational materials that merely describe products are not considered valuable inducements.  Offering discounts, gift cards or waiving the first premium to induce a sale would constitute illegal rebating.",
    "difficulty": "medium",

      "Offering a client a discount on premiums if they purchase a policy",

    "question": "Mark operates a tree removal business in Tennessee and carries workers’ compensation insurance.  After an employee is injured, Mark claims the worker was not acting within the scope of employment.  What must the workers’ compensation insurer do?",
    "correct": "Investigate the claim to determine whether the injury occurred in the course of employment",
    "explanation": "Insurers must investigate all workers’ compensation claims to determine whether the injury arose out of and in the course of employment.  They cannot simply deny claims based on the employer’s assertion.  Depending on the investigation’s outcome, benefits will either be paid or denied.  The insurer cannot shift the costs to the employee without investigation.",

    "correct": "Twenty‑four hours, including at least three hours of ethics",

    "correct": "Ten days from receipt of the policy",
    "explanation": "In Tennessee, life insurance purchasers have at least 10 days (and sometimes longer under certain policies) to review the policy and cancel it for a full refund without penalty.

    "explanation": "Homeowners insurance covers sudden and accidental losses caused by covered perils such as wind.  Insurers may deduct for pre‑existing wear and tear and pay only for the damage directly attributable to the covered event.  They do not have to pay for the cost of replacing worn‑out components unrelated to the peril.",

Tennessee law makes a person who sells or aids such unauthorized insurance personally liable for the premiums collected and for valid claims under those contracts:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

    "explanation": "The Commissioner may issue a temporary producer license for a period not exceeding 180 days (approximately six months):contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}. No exam is required for a temporary license. It is typically granted to an appropriate individual (for example, the spouse or personal representative of a deceased or incapacitated agent, or a designee when an agent is called to active military service) so that they can continue servicing or wind down the existing insurance business.

    "correct": "The producer has been officially reported for failing to pay court-ordered child support.",

Under Tennessee law, if a licensee is delinquent on child support, their professional license (including an insurance producer license) can be suspended after due notice from the child support enforcement authorities:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.

    "explanation": "An insurance producer facing license revocation or suspension is entitled to due process.

Tennessee, like all states, prohibits rebating:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}.

Requiring the borrower to use the lender’s affiliate insurer to get the loan is coercion. (This violates the free choice of insurance and anti-tying provisions.)

    "explanation": "Tennessee law requires that life insurance policies include a grace period of one month for the payment of each premium after the first:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}.

The notice must be signed by both the producer and the applicant, and copies go to the applicant and the new (replacing) insurance company.
