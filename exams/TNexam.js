{
    "question": "Which of the following is an unfair trade practice under Tennessee insurance laws that could subject a producer to disciplinary action?",
    "correct": "Promising a prospective client that a specific claim will be paid before underwriting is complete",
    "explanation": "Under Tennessee’s Unfair Trade Practices Act, misrepresentations or false statements about policy coverage are prohibited.  Telling a consumer that a claim will be paid without underwriting is a misrepresentation because the producer does not yet know whether the risk will be accepted.  Offering small promotional gifts within statutory limits, explaining coverage in plain language and declining to write high‑risk business based on sound underwriting are all permitted.",
    "difficulty": "easy",
    "wrongs": [
      "Offering a promotional gift valued at $20 for a referral",
      "Explaining policy benefits in simple terms",
      "Refusing to issue a policy to a high‑risk applicant based on valid underwriting guidelines"
    ],
{
    "question": "Under Tennessee law, how long must an insurance producer maintain client and transaction records after a policy terminates or a transaction is completed?",
    "correct": "At least five years",
    "explanation": "Tennessee regulations require insurers, general agents and producers to keep records used in insurance transactions for at least five years after the policy terminates or the transaction is completed.  These records must be available to the commissioner for market conduct examinations.  Keeping records for three, six or seven years is not sufficient under the Tennessee rules.",

      "Three years",
      "Six years",
      "Seven years"
    ],
{
    "question": "Under Tennessee insurance law, which of the following practices constitutes rebating and is prohibited for producers?",
    "correct": "Refunding part of the producer’s commission to the client as an incentive to buy a policy",
    "explanation": "Rebating occurs when a producer offers or returns any portion of the premium, commission or other valuable consideration to induce the purchase of an insurance policy.  Tennessee law specifically prohibits offering to refund part of the producer’s commission as an inducement.  Adjusting premiums based on the insured’s risk profile is legal underwriting, and giving small promotional items is permitted if their value is within statutory limits.",
    "difficulty": "easy",
    "wrongs": [
      "Offering a client a discount on premiums for maintaining a good driving record",
      "Providing a small promotional item such as a calendar",
      "Adjusting premiums based on the insured’s risk profile"
    ],
{
    "question": "Which statement about the fiduciary responsibilities of Tennessee insurance producers is true?",
    "correct": "Producers must hold clients’ premium funds in a fiduciary (trust) capacity and may not use them for personal expenses",
    "explanation": "Tennessee law requires producers to treat premium funds as trust funds.  Money received for soliciting, negotiating or selling insurance must be held in a fiduciary capacity and cannot be commingled or misappropriated.  This duty applies to all lines of insurance, not just life insurance, and producers must provide an accounting of funds upon request.",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "wrongs": [
      "Producers may commingle client funds with business funds if records are kept",
      "Fiduciary responsibility applies only to life insurance policies",
      "Producers need not account for client funds unless specifically asked"
    ],
{
    "question": "Which scenario describes the unfair trade practice known as twisting?",
    "correct": "A producer persuades a client to replace an existing policy with a new one by providing misleading information about the current policy",
    "explanation": "Twisting is the practice of inducing a policyholder to replace an existing policy with a new one through misrepresentation.  The agent typically emphasizes perceived deficiencies in the current contract or misstates benefits of the new contract in order to earn a new commission.  Recommending additional coverage or a replacement that truly improves coverage is not twisting.",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "wrongs": [
      "A producer encourages a client to purchase additional coverage for their home",
      "A producer replaces a policy with one that provides significantly better coverage",
      "A producer suggests moving to another insurer for a better premium rate without misrepresentation"
    ],
{
    "question": "Which of the following is considered misrepresentation and thus an unfair trade practice under Tennessee law?",
    "correct": "Falsely stating that a policy includes coverage that it does not provide",
    "explanation": "Misrepresentation involves providing false or misleading information about a policy’s benefits, conditions or terms.  Claiming a policy covers something when it does not is a clear example.  Offering small promotional gifts, speaking truthfully about a competitor’s policy and recommending additional coverage based on a client’s needs are allowed practices.",
    "difficulty": "easy",
    "wrongs": [
      "Offering a client a promotional gift valued at $15",

      "Recommending additional coverage based on a client’s risk profile"
    ],
{
    "question": "After an insurance producer mistakenly records a client’s age incorrectly on a life application, resulting in a lower premium, what will the insurer typically do when the error is discovered?",
    "correct": "Adjust the death benefit to reflect the premium actually paid",
    "explanation": "Life policies contain a misstatement‑of‑age clause.  If the insured’s age was misstated, the insurer will adjust the death benefit to the amount that the paid premium would have purchased at the correct age.  Policies are not cancelled solely for an honest age mistake, and producers are not personally required to pay the difference or bill the client retroactively.",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "wrongs": [
      "Cancel the policy and refund the premiums",
      "Require the producer to pay the premium difference",
      "Retroactively bill the client for the difference in premiums"

{
    "question": "Sarah bought a health insurance policy in Tennessee.  Two months later she is diagnosed with a condition she had before purchasing the policy.  Her insurer refuses to pay for treatment, citing a pre‑existing condition clause.  Is this denial valid?",
    "correct": "No, insurers cannot deny claims for pre‑existing conditions once a policy is in effect",
    "explanation": "Under the Affordable Care Act and Tennessee regulations, health insurers cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of a pre‑existing condition.  Once a major medical policy is issued and active, the insurer must cover the insured’s medical needs, even if the condition existed before the effective date.  Coverage may be denied only if the insured failed to disclose the condition fraudulently or the plan is a grandfathered policy not subject to the ACA.",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "wrongs": [
      "Yes, the denial is valid because the condition existed before the policy was issued",
      "Yes, if Sarah failed to disclose the condition on her application",
      "No, because Tennessee requires a six‑month waiting period before denying such claims"
    ],
{
    "question": "How often must Tennessee insurance producers renew their licenses?",
    "correct": "Every two years",
    "explanation": "Tennessee insurance producers must renew their licenses every two years.  As part of the renewal process, producers must complete the required continuing education credits and file for renewal before the expiration date.  Renewal periods of one, three and five years do not apply.",

      "Every three years",
      "Every five years"
    ],
{
    "question": "Which of the following would not be considered rebating or an illegal inducement under Tennessee insurance law?",
    "correct": "Providing a client with educational brochures about insurance products",
    "explanation": "Rebating involves offering any value not stated in the policy to induce someone to purchase insurance.  Educational materials that merely describe products are not considered valuable inducements.  Offering discounts, gift cards or waiving the first premium to induce a sale would constitute illegal rebating.",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "wrongs": [
      "Offering a client a discount on premiums if they purchase a policy",
      "Giving a client a $50 gift card as an incentive to purchase a policy",
      "Waiving the first month’s premium to close a sale"
    ],
{
    "question": "How many continuing education (CE) hours must a licensed Tennessee insurance producer complete every two years?",
    "correct": "Twenty‑four hours, including at least three hours of ethics",
    "explanation": "Tennessee insurance producers must complete 24 hours of continuing education during each two‑year renewal cycle.  At least three of these hours must be in ethics.  Twelve and fifteen hours are insufficient, while 30 hours exceed the statutory requirement.",

    "wrongs": [
      "Twelve hours",
      "Fifteen hours",
      "Thirty hours"
    ],
{
    "question": "What is the free‑look period for life insurance policies in Tennessee?",
    "correct": "Ten days from receipt of the policy",
    "explanation": "In Tennessee, life insurance purchasers have at least 10 days (and sometimes longer under certain policies) to review the policy and cancel it for a full refund without penalty.  Fifteen‑, twenty‑ and thirty‑day periods are longer than the statutory minimum, but the question asks for the minimum period.",

      "Thirty days"
    ],
{
    "question": "Which of the following is required to obtain an insurance adjuster license in Tennessee?",
    "correct": "Passing a licensing examination",
    "explanation": "To become a licensed insurance adjuster in Tennessee, an applicant must pass the appropriate licensing exam, meet any pre‑licensing education requirements, complete an application and pay the required fees.  A college degree, years of experience or a recommendation from an insurer are not mandated by law.",
    "difficulty": "easy",
    "wrongs": [
      "Holding a bachelor’s degree in business or finance",
      "Having a minimum of three years of insurance experience",
      "Obtaining a recommendation from an insurance company"

{
    "question": "What penalties may the Tennessee insurance commissioner impose on a producer who engages in unfair or deceptive practices?",
    "correct": "The commissioner may suspend, revoke or refuse the producer’s license and/or impose civil fines",
    "explanation": "If a producer violates Tennessee insurance laws — including committing unfair trade practices — the commissioner may place the producer on probation, suspend or revoke the license, refuse to issue or renew it, and impose civil penalties.  Often the commissioner employs a combination of these remedies to protect consumers and enforce compliance.",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "wrongs": [
      "Only suspend the producer’s license",
      "Only revoke the license without fines",
      "Only issue a warning with no further consequences"

{
    "question": "Which of the following is an action the Tennessee Commissioner of Insurance may take upon finding that an insurance producer has violated insurance laws?",
    "correct": "Suspend or revoke the producer’s license (after proper notice and hearing).",
    "explanation": "The Commissioner has broad authority to enforce the insurance laws. This includes placing a producer on probation, suspending or revoking the license, or imposing civil penalties, but always in accordance with due process (notice and opportunity for a hearing):contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. The Commissioner cannot directly imprison individuals or change contract terms – criminal penalties would be handled by the courts, not the Commissioner.",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "wrongs": [
      "Impose imprisonment of the producer for up to one year.",
      "Unilaterally change the terms of the producer’s insurance contracts.",

{
    "question": "Under Tennessee law, what is the maximum civil penalty **per violation** the Commissioner may impose for a knowing (willful) violation of an insurance statute or rule?",
    "correct": "$25,000 per violation.",
    "explanation": "For unintentional violations, Tennessee law allows fines up to $1,000 per violation (capped at $100,000 total). However, if a person knowingly violates an insurance law or order, the Commissioner can impose up to $25,000 for each violation, with an aggregate limit of $250,000:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.",

{
    "question": "In Tennessee, an \"insurance producer\" is best defined as:",
    "correct": "A person (individual or business entity) required to be licensed to sell, solicit, or negotiate insurance.",
    "explanation": "Tennessee uses the term *insurance producer* to refer to anyone who must be licensed to sell, solicit, or negotiate insurance products in the state:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. This includes traditional agents (and brokers), and can include business entities (agencies) acting through designated individuals. Insurers themselves are separate entities and clients who purchase insurance are not \"producers.\"",

    "wrongs": [
      "An insurance company authorized to sell policies in Tennessee.",
      "Any person who purchases an insurance policy for another party.",

{
    "question": "What is a consequence if a Tennessee-licensed producer sells insurance for an insurer that is not authorized (an **unauthorized insurer**) in Tennessee?",
    "correct": "The producer can be held personally liable for any premiums and unpaid claims on policies sold for the unauthorized insurer.",
    "explanation": "Transacting business with an unauthorized (non-admitted) insurer is illegal. Tennessee law makes a person who sells or aids such unauthorized insurance personally liable for the premiums collected and for valid claims under those contracts:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}. This deters producers from placing business with insurers that have not been licensed or approved in the state. Such policies are not protected by Tennessee insurance regulations or guaranty associations.",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "wrongs": [
      "The state guaranty association will pay the claims instead of the insurer.",
      "There is no penalty as long as the client agrees in writing to use a non-admitted insurer.",
      "Only the insurer is penalized; the producer faces no consequences."

{
    "question": "Which of the following is a requirement to obtain a resident insurance **producer license** in Tennessee?",
    "correct": "Be at least 18 years of age and successfully pass the required licensing examination.",
    "explanation": "To earn a resident producer license in Tennessee, an applicant must meet general requirements of the Tennessee Insurance Producer Licensing Act. Key requirements include being at least 18 years old, establishing Tennessee residency, completing any required prelicensing education (for certain lines), and passing the state licensing exam:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}. (Additional steps include submitting an application, fees, and fingerprints for a background check.) There is no college-degree requirement, and insurer appointments are obtained *after* licensure, not before.",

{
    "question": "Which statement is true about **nonresident** producer licensing in Tennessee?",
    "correct": "A nonresident licensed in good standing in their home state can obtain a Tennessee producer license without taking the TN exam.",
    "explanation": "Tennessee, like other states, grants nonresident producer licenses by reciprocity. If you are licensed and in good standing as a producer in your home state, you may apply for a nonresident TN license for the same lines of authority without having to retake an examination:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}. Nonresidents must still apply and pay fees, but they are not required to maintain a physical office in Tennessee. Their license term and obligations (such as renewals) are similar to residents, but they generally satisfy CE requirements via their home state.",

    "question": "How long is a **temporary insurance producer license** valid in Tennessee, and who may receive one?",
    "correct": "It is valid for up to 180 days and is issued to someone like a surviving spouse, business partner, or court-appointed representative of a disabled or deceased producer to service the insurance business.",
    "explanation": "The Commissioner may issue a temporary producer license for a period not exceeding 180 days (approximately six months):contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}. No exam is required for a temporary license. It is typically granted to an appropriate individual (for example, the spouse or personal representative of a deceased or incapacitated agent, or a designee when an agent is called to active military service) so that they can continue servicing or wind down the existing insurance business. Temporary licenses are strictly limited in scope and duration, and the Commissioner can revoke a temporary license if it’s not in the public interest.",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "wrongs": [
      "It is valid for 90 days and can be given to any new trainee agent to start selling insurance immediately.",

    "question": "How many **continuing education (CE)** credits must a Tennessee insurance producer complete to renew their license?",
    "correct": "24 credit hours of approved continuing education every two years (biennially), including at least 3 hours of ethics courses.",
    "explanation": "Tennessee producers must fulfill ongoing education to keep their knowledge current. The requirement is 24 hours of continuing education each two-year license cycle. Within those 24 hours, at least 3 hours must be on ethics topics:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}. (Certain specialized training, such as a one-time annuity suitability course or long-term care partnership training, may also be required if selling those products. Nonresident agents are generally exempt from TN’s CE if they meet their home state’s CE.)",

{
    "question": "Which of the following could result in the Commissioner **suspending an insurance producer’s license** in Tennessee?",
    "correct": "The producer has been officially reported for failing to pay court-ordered child support.",
    "explanation": "Besides insurance law violations, certain other offenses can trigger license suspension. Under Tennessee law, if a licensee is delinquent on child support, their professional license (including an insurance producer license) can be suspended after due notice from the child support enforcement authorities:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}. This is an enforcement mechanism to encourage payment of support. Other causes for suspension or revocation include misrepresentation, fraud, felony conviction, etc., but not things like personal bankruptcy or missing sales targets (those are not legal violations).",

    "wrongs": [
      "The producer filed personal bankruptcy last year.",

{
    "question": "Misappropriating or improperly withholding **premiums** that a client paid is an example of what, in terms of license discipline in Tennessee?",
    "correct": "An act that is grounds for license revocation or suspension by the Commissioner.",
    "explanation": "Failing to properly remit client premiums (i.e., pocketing or misusing insurance premiums) is a serious violation. Tennessee law explicitly lists \"improperly withholding, misappropriating or converting\" money received in the course of insurance business as a cause for license suspension or revocation:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}. This fiduciary duty is taken very seriously. Such an act would be considered an unlawful misappropriation of funds, and the Commissioner can revoke the producer’s license for it. (It may also carry legal penalties for fraud.)",
    "difficulty": "easy",
    "wrongs": [
      "A legal practice allowed if the producer corrects it within 30 days.",
      "An unfair claims practice but not related to licensing (handled only by courts).",

{
    "question": "If the Commissioner decides to revoke or suspend a producer’s license for misconduct, what procedural right does the producer have under Tennessee law?",
    "correct": "The right to written notice of the charges and an opportunity for a **hearing** under the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act before the action is taken.",
    "explanation": "An insurance producer facing license revocation or suspension is entitled to due process. In Tennessee, any such disciplinary action must comply with the state’s Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, meaning the producer gets notice of the allegations and a chance for a hearing (a contested case hearing):contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}. Only after this can the Commissioner take final action. This protects the producer’s right to defend themselves. (There are some exceptions, like immediate suspension in child support cases or imminent harm situations, but even then a prompt post-suspension hearing is provided.)",

{
    "question": "An insurance agent in Tennessee offers a $100 gift card to a client as an incentive for purchasing a life insurance policy. Which **unfair trade practice** does this scenario describe?",
    "correct": "Rebating.",
    "explanation": "Rebating is the practice of offering something of value not specified in the policy (such as cash, gifts, or a portion of the agent’s commission) to induce someone to buy insurance. Tennessee, like all states, prohibits rebating:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}. In this scenario, the $100 gift card is a valuable consideration not stated in the policy, offered as an inducement to purchase – that is a classic example of rebating, which is illegal.

    "question": "A bank lender requires a borrower to buy a life insurance policy from the bank’s own affiliate as a condition for approving a loan. For insurance purposes, this practice is considered:",
    "correct": "Coercion (an unfair trade practice).",
    "explanation": "**Coercion** (or boycott/intimidation) in insurance is forcing or unduly pressuring someone into a transaction. In Tennessee, it’s an unfair trade practice for a person or entity to use their position (like a lender’s position over a borrower) to compel the purchase of insurance from a particular source:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}. Requiring the borrower to use the lender’s affiliate insurer to get the loan is coercion. (This violates the free choice of insurance and anti-tying provisions.) It’s not rebating (no gift is offered) and not discrimination in this context – it is coercive tying of insurance to a loan.",

    "question": "Making or circulating false, maliciously critical statements about an insurer’s financial condition in order to harm the insurer is an example of which unfair practice?",
    "correct": "Defamation.",
    "explanation": "In insurance, **defamation** refers to making false or derogatory statements about an insurer’s solvency, financial condition, or general reputation with the intent to injure. It is prohibited as an unfair trade practice:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}. In this case, spreading malicious falsehoods about an insurer’s finances fits the definition of defamation.

    "correct": "It is prohibited for insurance agents or companies to advertise or imply that the Guaranty Association will guarantee a policy’s benefits.",
    "explanation": "Under Tennessee law, it is an unfair trade practice to use the existence of the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association as a sales inducement:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}. Agents and insurers cannot advertise that the Association backs the policy’s benefits if the insurer fails. The Guaranty Association does provide a safety net (up to certain limits) for policyholders if an insurer becomes insolvent, but it is funded by assessments on insurers (not taxpayers) and has coverage limits.

    "question": "What is the **minimum grace period** for a life insurance premium payment in Tennessee (after the first premium is paid)?",
    "correct": "One month (at least 30 or 31 days) after the premium due date, during which the policy stays in force.",
    "explanation": "Tennessee law requires that life insurance policies include a grace period of one month for the payment of each premium after the first:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}. In practice, one month is typically interpreted as 30 or 31 days. If the insured dies during the grace period without having paid the premium, the insurer can deduct the overdue premium from the death benefit, but coverage cannot be terminated until the grace period expires. This grace period applies to all payments after the initial premium.",

If the policyowner decides to cancel within 10 days of delivery, they can return the policy for a full refund of any premium paid:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}. (If the policy is a replacement, insurers often extend the free-look to 20 days by rule, to allow more caution in replacing coverage.) This free-look provision is an important consumer protection, and the policy’s cover page will state the free-look duration.",

    "explanation": "Tennessee’s replacement rules require a producer who is involved in a policy replacement to give the applicant a signed notice explaining that a replacement is occurring and outlining the applicant’s rights and some considerations:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}. The notice must be signed by both the producer and the applicant, and copies go to the applicant and the new (replacing) insurance company. The producer must also list on the application any existing policies being replaced. It is not the producer’s role to directly notify the original insurer; instead, the replacing insurer will notify the existing insurer about the replacement.

    "correct": "Hold a life insurance license and complete a one-time approved training course on annuity suitability before soliciting any annuity sales.",
    "explanation": "Fixed and indexed annuities are regulated as life insurance in Tennessee, so a producer must have a life insurance line of authority to sell them. In addition, Tennessee has adopted the NAIC Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model regulation. This means producers must complete a one-time annuity training course (typically 4 hours covering annuity types, suitability, and disclosures) before selling annuities:contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}. The producer also has to follow suitability guidelines – i.e., gather the client’s financial information and ensure any annuity recommendation is in the client’s best interest. (A securities license is only required for **variable** annuities, not for fixed or indexed annuities.)",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "wrongs": [
      "Obtain a separate \"annuities producer\" license endorsement from the Department.",
      "No special license or training – any licensed producer can sell annuities with no additional requirements.",
      "Be registered with FINRA (have a securities license) in all cases to sell any annuity product."
